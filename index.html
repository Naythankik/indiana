        <ul>
          <li>
            A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was
            born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
          </li>

          <li>
            Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras
            Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO).
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where
            he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch
            vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a
            number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname
            <strong> “Missile Man.”</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
            ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was
            launched in 1989.
          </li>
          <li>
            He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
            role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
            the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
          </li>
          <li>
            From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense
            minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser
            (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
          </li>
          <li>
            His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
            solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
            national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
            international community.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology
            Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India
            from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan
            called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural
            productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic
            growth, and widening access to health care and education.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from
            <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India honoured him with
            the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the
            <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and
            his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat
            Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and
            modernization of defense technology in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the
            National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management
            and leadership of a space-related project".
          </li>
          <li>
            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
            Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest
            on
            <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed
            <b>Kalam Island</b> in September 2015.
          </li>
          <li>
            A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to
            <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
            in August 2015.
          </li>
          <li>
            In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India
            named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
            honour.
